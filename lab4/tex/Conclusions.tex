\section*{Conclusions}

While doing these laboratory I have learned about what are the bitmaps, how they are drawn to the screen, and which problems this might cause. Also I have implemented a technique of passing these problems. More than that, from literature I have learned about how we can create a bitmap, which will have the desired region transparent, after applying a mask on it. 

I must mention also, that the collision system is not a perfect one. Sometimes it might happen that two or more objects are stuck one in another. This is due to several reasons. For example, when an object is transformed at the exact moment it occurs collision with another object, it may happen that the new shape will overlap with the impacted shape. Also, if we press too fast on the button for adding new balls, with 100 percent probability will occur the overlapping of multiple objects, causing interesting glitches.
