\section*{Conclusions}

This lab was a pretty useful for us, because such things as menus are necessary for almost every application which has to interact with users. Also working with menus, icons and cursors gave us insight about what are the resources in win32. The dialogues are also a very user-friendly feature, which is used to allow user understand that he controls the situation.

So, in such a way, we now are able to develop different applications which could become commercial in future.
