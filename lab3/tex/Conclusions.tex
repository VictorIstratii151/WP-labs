While performing this lab I've understood why is so necessary to handle all the painting operations in the wm_paint. This gives the possibility, when storing somewhere the drawn data, to redraw it efficiently every time the client area is invalidate. I've done such work with painting lines, and it took a lot of time. Unfortunately the other drawing operations are not handled in such a manner. 

Despite this, I've gained the necessary knowledge and experience for painting well in the next projects.
